# Important US Documents
## Description
#### This program begins with a menu asking you to type in a number that correlates with a specific US document (error prevention code is written to prevent the program from crashing if the user enters an incorrect value). After entering a correct value, a list is then displayed showcasing a list of all the word in said document and counting how many of that one word shows up. There is also a a point where the list stops and then the user must press any key to continue viewing the full list. This is rinse and repeated until the program reaches the end and the user is given a choice of running the program again or stopping the program.
## How to View
#### Sign into GitHub and run a codespace on the repository, then select 'AssignmentEM10.py' and run the code to be able to interact with the program. If you are not able to sign-in, then simply look over to both 'Output1.PNG' and 'Output2.PNG' to see an example of what the program outputs.
